## Project Overview
This project is an analysis of data for the annual football club competition, the UEFA Champions League (UCL) for the years 2016 to 2022. This analysis is gearded towards getting specific information regarding players, managers, clubs, stadiums and goals from the competition.

## Data Sources
UEFA Champions League 2016-2022 Data:  The primary data for this analysis is the "UEFA Champions League 2016-2022 Data.xlsx" file. This file is made up of a number of sheets with data on teams, players, managers, stadiums, goals and matches for the period under consideration

## Tools Used
1. Microsoft Excel - Data Loading and Inspection
2. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studios (SSMS) - Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Microsoft Power BI Desktop - Data Visualization

## Data Loading and Inspection
This was done using Microsoft Excel and involved loading the dataset and checking for duplicates using the excel duplicate finding feature

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This was done using SSMS to manipulate the data to get further insights. A variety of SQL functions such as select, case statements, order by, group by, subqueries, temporary tables, where clauses etc. were utilized to get answers a number of questions based on the given data. Some of the questions that this analysis set out to answer are as follows;
- Who were the top goal scorers within the given period?

- What was the Win/Loss record for the top teams?
- What were the stadiums with the highest capacity and average attendance?
- What is the current age range distribution for players?
- What is the current age range distrbution for managers?
- What is the goal distribution per half of football?

## Data Visualization
This aspect of the project was done using Microsoft Power BI. The visualization was done based on the insights gotten from the SQL Queries written to answer the above questions. A number of charts and graphs such as pie chart, column chart, bar chart etc. were used to visualize the insights gotten from the UEFA Champions League 2016-2022 Data.
